*Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project*

The project consists of the following files:

1. **run_analysis.R**, an R program to read in data from the Human Activity Recognition project. This data was collected
a group of 30 subjects divided into two groups, train and test, and for six different activities.
The data comprise 561 different attributes.

2. **tidydata.txt**, a text file created using write.table() that includes summary data for the complete data set. The
summary data (one row for each combination of Subject and Activity) includes the mean of each data attribute that
measures a mean or standard deviation. With 30 subjects and six activities, there are 180 rows in the summary
tidy data file.

3. **CodeBook.md**, a markdown file that describes the data cleaning process in detail.

4. **README.md**, this markdown file providing an overview of the git repository.
